### Quoridor Online

The goal of this project is to be the one-stop-shop for Quoridor 3D and any variant type games. It will begin with a user authentication system and ability to play a match against another user.

I'll be experimenting with bringing the whole system online using a serverless architecture. The turn based nature of Quoridor should make this possible but I suspect the networked camera movements may be pushing the limits of real time serverless. If it works though, that'd be great for scalability and hosting costs.

If all that works, I'd like to implement a scoreboard and friend system. Potentially game replay feature.
